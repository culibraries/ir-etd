## ETD Reviewer ##

ETD Reviewer is a productivity application for library staff to assist them with the review and updating of electronic theses and dissertations (ETD) prior to uploading to CU Scholar.

Theses / dissertations are submitted by students to ProQuest typically after the granting of a degree. ProQuest formats submitted documents and creates a metadata file describing the submission, both of which are returned to CU Boulder via FTP. Returned documents are then reviewed by library staff prior to final upload to CU Scholar. ETD Reviewer is the application that facilitates this review process.
